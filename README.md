# RickAndMorty

This is an Angular exercise where it has to be implemented a small app to show Rick and Morty characters, using this [API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#introduction). 

Requirements:
- [x] no bootstrap, material, etc
- [x] characters list
- [x] character detail in a modal
- [x] search input
- [x] pagination
- [x] add/remove favourite
- [x] favourites list

Extra:
- [x] show the list of episodes of a character in the detail modal
- [x] use typescript e types
- [x] design responsive 
- [ ] unit test & integration test

Note that this implementation can be easily improved, both code and UI wise. There is a better version implemented using React at this [repo](https://github.com/ARDbones/RickAndMorty-React).
